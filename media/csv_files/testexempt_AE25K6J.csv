The amount of information deleted ""shall be indicated on the released portion of the record and, if technically feasible, at the place in the record where the deletion was made."" Id. § 25-19-105(f)(3). All costs incurred in separating exempt from non-exempt information are to be borne by the custodian of the records. Id. § 25-19-105(f)(4).
The requester is a professional journalist employed at BuzzFeed requested documents will be made available to the general public, both through reported articles and Muckrock.com. This request is not being made for commercial purposes.
